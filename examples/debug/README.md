## About

The underlying socketio and engineio packages emit a lot of logs so it may be useful to filter out streamlabsio logs.

This example prints raw messages whenever Client.event_handler() receives data.

## Use

Run the script and trigger any of the events with `Test Widgets` in the Streamlabs GUI.
